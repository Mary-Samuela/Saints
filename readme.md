# My Favourite Saints Website

## Project Overview
This is a simple HTML and CSS website dedicated to **my favourite saints**.  
It displays a collection of saint photos, their feast days, and short captions.  
The website also includes a short biography about the project and a design plan section.

The idea behind the project is inspired by the quote:  

> *“Photography is a way of feeling, touching, and of loving.  
> What you have caught on film is captured forever.  
> It remembers the little things, long after you have forgotten everything.”*
