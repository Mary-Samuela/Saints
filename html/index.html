                Images of saints carry a silent but powerful message, 
                reminding us of lives lived with courage, faith, and love. 
                They inspire us to imitate their virtues, 
                turning what we see into a call to live more meaningfully.

            <h2>About this Website</h2>
            <p>
                This website is dedicated to my favourite Saints, 
                holy men and women who inspire me by their faith, courage and love.
                Here I collect their images and short notes about them 
                so that their <strong>witness</strong>  may remain alive in my memory just like how 
                photography captures the <em>little things</em> forever.
